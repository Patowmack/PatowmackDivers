          Inia, Paul, Larry and Eric dove the Floriday Keys from May 15 to May
          21. Inia flew down a day early, but the rest of us flew down on
          Sunday.

          Thursday Larry and Paul did two dives on the Vandenberg off of Key
          West. Eric and Inia decided that the stormy weather and rough seas
          were more than they wanted to deal with. Eric wandered around Key West
          hitting Heminway's old hangout (Sloppy Joe's), the Mel Fischer
          Maritime Museum, and the Audubon House (where Audubon never visited).
          Sloppy Joe's is better for beer than food.

          Friday we took a ferry, the Yankee Freedom, out to Garden Key and Fort
          Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, 70 miles west of Key West. The Frerry
          is a catamaran and took about 2:15 in each direction. We took a tour
          of the fort and appreciated the hardships that the prisioners
          (including Dr. Mudd) endured. The only natural water in the Dry
          Tortugas is rainwater, and there isn't much of that. Everything has to
          be hauled After lunch (included in the ticket) we snorkled. I have
          done a lot more diving than snorkling, but the snorkling was fun. I
          have snorkled in my wetsuit, but found that my natural boyancy was
          enough that I didn't need anything more. It was a challenge to
          identify the fish (parrotfish, etc.) because they appeared paler and
          we viewed them from the top.
        </p>

          Larry, Paul, and Eric flew back direct from Key West to National
          Airport. Inia spent a few more days in the Keys.
