        <h3 class="text-center">February 2016</h3>

        <p>
          Larry, Bruce B, and Eric spent a week (February 21-26) on the
          Caribbean Explorer II as it went from St. Maarten to Saba to St.
          Kitts. They flew down to St. Maarten on Saturday, February 20 to
          explore St. Marten before boarding the CEII the next afternoon.
        </p>

        <p>
          There was no diving at St. Kitts. The CEII motored to Saba after a
          briefing and Sunday dinner. Diving at Saba is supposed to have 100
          foot plus visibility, but that week it was less than 50 feet. At the
          end of one dive a white cloud of sediment that had been stirred up by
          swells from the north “chased” them out of the water and back on the
          boat. The visibility off St. Kitts was much better. Usually Saba has
          the better diving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Generally there were two morning, two afternoon dives, plus a night
          dive. Hot chocolate, Kahlua and Bailey’s greeted divers (and those not
          diving) after the night dive.
        </p>

        <p>I got in 24 dives, including two night dives.</p>

        <p>
          On one dive we saw two scorpion fish fighting. They tried to bite off
          each others head. It took about 10 minutes before the winner was able
          to convince the loser to leave the reef. Well, the loser moved five
          feet.
        </p>

        <p>
          We took land tours of Saba and St. Kitts. We improvised a land tour of
          St. Maarten on Saturday after we settled into our hotel.
        </p>

        <p><i>Pluses:</i></p>
        <p>
          <li>The boat crew were great.</li>
          <li>The price was reasonable for a live aboard.</li>
          <li>
            The boat had an open bar with beer, wine, and liquor with the usual
            no diving after drinking rule.
          </li>
          <li>The food was excellent.</li>
          <li>
            Tanks were refilled with your choice of air or nitrox (extra charge)
            while strapped in with your BC.
          </li>
          <li>
            Larry booked the flights first so Bruce and I followed his lead.
            Going down on Saturday was a good idea. If something had gone wrong,
            we could have gone directly from the airport to the boat on Sunday.
          </li>
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Minuses:</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>Cabins were small.</li>
          <li>The cabins did not have individual temperature control.</li>
          <li>
            The hung a floating granny line from the stern to the bow to use to
            get to the mooring line, which we used to descend. I had a medium
            size camera with dual strobes. This made it difficult for me to use
            the line. It would have been better if they had used chains that
            would sink or dropped a down line off the stern.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our return flight was delayed because the airplane arrived late from
            Miami and there were rain storms. We connected through Miami on our
            way home. I have TSA GlobalEntry and with some help from an American
            Airlines employee made my connecting flight to Washington. Bruce and
            Larry spent the night in Miami, and returned home via LaGuardia.
          </li>
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Bottom line:</i> I would do it again, but I would do some research
          about the best time of the year to go diving around Saba. I would try
          to avoid Miami.
