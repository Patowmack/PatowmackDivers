            Erik Petkovic will talk at about the U-1105, which is sunk in the
            Potomac. His talk will start at
            <b>8:15 pm following club business.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            U-1105 is a modified Type VII-C German submarine built at the
            Nordseewerke Shipyard in Emden, Germany, and was commissioned in the
            Kriegsmarine. Nicknamed "Black Panther", U-1105 was one of only 13
            submarines outfitted with an experimental rubber skin known as
            Alberich. The skin was designed to evade Allied sonar - an early
            stealth technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            During U-1105's only war patrol, she torpedoed the British frigate
            HMS Redmill killing 32 crewmen.
          </p>
          <p>
            U-1105 surrendered at Loch Eriboll, Scotland at the end of World War
            Two and was a sought-after war prize for study of its unique rubber
            skin. After radar, snorkel, and noise trials by the British Royal
            Navy, U- 1105 was transferred to the US Navy which used U-1105 for
            explosive testing.
          </p>

          <p>
            A 250-pound depth charge sent U-1105 to the bottom of the Potomac
            River in 1949 for the sixth and final time. U-1105 remained lost to
            history until she was re-discovered in 1985 in 91 feet (27.7 meters)
            of water. U-1105 is the most accessible U-boat off the US East
            Coast.
