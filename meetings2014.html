          YES, WE'RE MEETING ON THE SECOND WEDNESDAY! We will have a special
          presentation form Amir Fogel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amir Fogel is a graduate of Hampshire College in Amherst, MA. There he
          studied marine biology, with a focus in shark behavior and
          conservation, and documentary film. Amir has spent time volunteering
          in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve near Tulum, Mexico as well as a
          volunteer diver at the Maritime Aquarium of Norwalk in CT. In
          addition, he is a PADI certified Dive Master and has just returned
          from working at a dive shop in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. His documentary,
          Niche, explores the many intricacies of current shark conservation
          measures. The film is a compilation of personal footage, stock
          footage, and interviews with professionals from many backgrounds.
          Niche is intended to first establish the importance of sharks to the
          survival of marine ecosystems, followed by a unique glance into the
          complexities of the challenges in current shark conservation measures.
          What sets, Niche, apart from other shark conservation films is the
          representation of diverse perspectives. Bringing the voices of
          commercial fishermen, scientists, and conservationists all to the
          table, in order to discuss the future of shark conservation.

        <p>
          Club member Ed Bullinger will talk about diving and underwater
          photography using one of his favorite dive sites: under the Blue Heron
          Bridge in West Palm Beach. The bridge is a really great shore dive and
          several club members go down to West Palm Beach once or twice a year
          to dive it. Of course, there's also great boat diving off West Palm.
          Ed was a professional photographer in the West Palm Beach area.
