        <h6>Wednesday, September 7, 2011</h6>
        Marvin Barrash will discuss his book on the U.S.S. Cyclops. From the day
        it was realized that the U.S.S. Cyclops would never arrive at her
        destination, much attention has been drawn to the subject of this
        colossal collier. Many have been curious because of the mystery
        surrounding her disappearance in the area known as the Bermuda Triangle.
        Others are interested in naval history and some because of a family
        connection to a member of her crew. For more details click
