          Divers know our reefs are under threat, but you can help protect them
          (and yourself) every time you apply sunscreen. Ingredients like
          oxybenzone, parabens and mineral oils in sunscreens and body-care
          products can harm our oceans, rivers, lakes and streams. Studies have
          shown that coral-reef damage can be caused by these ingredients and
          they are making their way into the waterways and popular reefs in
          surprisingly high concentrations. Join us as we welcome Mike Materre,
          Vice President of Stream2Sea, who will tell the story of the
          development of this reef-safe sunscreen and body-care products company
          founded in 2015 by Autumn Blum, a cosmetic chemist and scuba diver.
          Where: Zoom information will be sent at a later time.

          Palm Beach. The water under BHB abounds in small creatures such as

          dives finding them and photographing them. See her pictures on
